/**
 * If we take a closer look at the insertion sort code, we can notice that every iteration of while loop reduces one inversion.
 * The while loop executes only if i > j and arr[i] < arr[j].
 * Therefore total number of while loop iterations (For all values of i) is same as number of inversions.
 * Therefore overall time complexity of the insertion sort is O(n + f(n)) where f(n) is inversion count.
 * If the inversion count is O(n), then the time complexity of insertion sort is O(n).
 * In worst case, there can be n*(n-1)/2 inversions.
 * The worst case occurs when the array is sorted in reverse order. So the worst case time complexity of insertion sort is O(n2).
 * Best case: O(n)
 * Worst case: O(n^2)
 * <p>
 * [5, 6, 2, 1, 3]
 * i = 1, key = 6 : [5, 6, 2, 1, 3]
 * i = 2, key = 2 : [5, 6, 6, 1, 3] -> [5, 5, 6, 1, 3] -> [2, 5, 6, 1, 3]
 * i = 3, key = 1 : [2, 5, 6, 1, 3] -> [2, 5, 6, 6, 3] -> [2, 5, 5, 6, 3] -> [2, 2, 5, 6, 3] -> [1, 5, 5, 6, 3]
 * and so on...
